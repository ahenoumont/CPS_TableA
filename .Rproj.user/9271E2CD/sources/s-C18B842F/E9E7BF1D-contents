#Bureau of Labor Statistics: Table A-1.. Employment status of the civilian population by sex and age
*by ALEXANDER HENOUMONT*


##Introduction
This project will recreate the Bureau of Labor Statistics July 2018 report of the Employment data Using the Current Population Survey found [here] (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm)


Data was obtained from the Data Ferret Application and pulled on 1 Sep 2018.

The variables of interest are PESEX, PESEX, PEMLR, PRPERTYP, PRWNTJO

Explanation of variables
  HRHHID: Household Identifier. Each observation is an individual and this variable is a decribes all individuals in a given household.
  **HRHHID2**: Household Identifier
  **OCCURNUM**: Unique person identifier.
  **YYYYMM**: Year and month observation was taken
  **PESEX**: Gender
    1 = Male
    2 = Female
  **PRTAGE**:
    Age
    80 = 80-84
    85 = 85+
  **PEMLR**:Employment type
    1	EMPLOYED-AT WORK
    2	EMPLOYED-ABSENT
    3	UNEMPLOYED-ON LAYOFF
    4	UNEMPLOYED-LOOKING
    5	NOT IN LABOR FORCE-RETIRED
    6	NOT IN LABOR FORCE-DISABLED
    7	NOT IN LABOR FORCE-OTHER
  **PRPERTYP**: Person Type
    1	CHILD HOUSEHOLD MEMBER
    2	ADULT CIVILIAN HOUSEHOLD MEMBER
    3	ADULT ARMED FORCES HOUSEHOLD MEMBER
  **PRWNTJOB**
    1 YES
    2 NO

##Import Data
  Since there is only an availavle API for the poverty data on the CPS, the data had to be pulled manually from the [Data Farret] (thedataweb.census.gov) application. The following variables were queried on 1 Sept 2018 from *July 2017, March, April, May, June* and *July 2018* tables: *PESEX, PESEX, PEMLR, PRPERTYP, PRWNTJOB*. 
```{r message=FALSE}

temp <-  list.files(pattern="*.csv")
cpsData = as_data_frame(lapply(temp, read_csv) %>% bind_rows())

```

**************************************************
##Creating the Tables##
Using *dplyr* package in R, the tables could be created with a single command. The tables consists of 10 variables, 6 variables that have to be queried and the other 3 were merely ratios of the previous 6.

#Table A-1. Employment status of the civilian population by sex and age

#TOTAL
```{r}
tableA_total <- cpsData %>% 
  group_by(YYYYMM) %>% 
  summarize(`Civilian population` = n(),
            `Civilian labor force` = sum(PRPERTYP == 2),
            Employed = sum(PEMLR == 1 | PEMLR == 2),
            Unemployed = sum(PEMLR == 3 | PEMLR == 4),
            `Not in labor force` = sum(PEMLR == 5 | PEMLR == 6),
            `Person wants job` = sum(PRWNTJOB == 1)) %>% 
  mutate(`Participation rate` = `Civilian labor force` / `Civilian population` * 100,
         `Employment-population ratio` = Employed / `Civilian population` * 100,
         `Unemployment rate` = Unemployed / `Civilian population` * 100) %>%
